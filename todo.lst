Docker

Extra challenges for the compose stack
1. The names of the Docker containers running the services should
be alpha, bravo and charlie. X

2. The hostnames of the service containers should be alpha, bravo and charlie. X

3. All three containers should be on a dedicated Docker network named conti-test.
The conti-test network should be a block of 64 IP addresses starting
with 172.16.100.128. The containers should have the following IP addresses:
o alpha: 172.16.100.140
bravo: 172.16.100.141
charlie: 172.16.100.142 X

4. When executing make up, the containers should come up in the following order:
o alpha
bravo
charlie X

5. The sshd process running in charlie should have access to two extra environment
variables: CONTI_ENV and CONTI_DB_NAME. If the user sets and exports these variables in
the shell environment before executing make up, their values should be visible by the
sshd process running inside charlie.

6. If the CONTI_ENV variable is not set by the user, it should default to prod.

7. If the CONTI_DB_NAME variable is not set by the user, make up should fail with the
following error message: "You must specify CONTI_DB_NAME in the environment."

8. If the kernel runs short of memory and decides to unleash the OOM
killer, charlie should have more chance to survive than alpha and bravo.

9. The sshd process running in charlie should be able to open at least 1048576 file
descriptors.

10. Bravo should not be able to use more than 10% of a single CPU core. X

11. Bravo should not be able to use more than 4 GB of memory. X

12. Bravo should not start until the sshd running in alpha does not open its listening
port. Charlie should not start until the sshd running in bravo does not open its
listening port. X



Ansible

1. The timezone inside the containers should be set to the value of the timezone Ansible
inventory variable. (note: it's not a problem if Ansible throws warnings during the
execution of this task due to missing systemd components if the contents
of /etc/timezone reflect the desired change) X

2. APT inside the containers should be configured to use the APT mirror specified by
the apt_mirror Ansible inventory variable. An example value for the apt_mirror variable
would be http://ftp.hosteurope.de/mirror/archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu (one of the
official Ubuntu mirror servers
